### Welcome to the Cambridge University Estonian Society webpage!

CUEST has been created to gather all Estonians in Cambridge but also
those interested in Estonia, its language and culture. Currently we
have about 40 members.

The Society happily supports all new Estonians coming to study to
Cambridge and as a source of information for all those interested in
studying at Cambridge.

We invite all Estonians studying and working in Cambridge to join us!
If you have any questions, please contact us on
